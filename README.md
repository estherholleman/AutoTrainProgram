# AutoTrainProgram

Run main.py, this will bring up the graphical interface of the program. 

Extra functions used in main.py are located in the 'secondary' folder. 

The Arduino folder contains the .ino files for the micro-controllers (feeder, master, and slave). It also includes several files for testing purposes (for instance test_I2C to test the I2C connection). 

An (initially empty) folder labeled 'experiments' should also be present in the same folder as main.py. This is where the results/outcomes of the training sessions will be saved.
